:zero: [two_movies_in_a_flight]()

Write a function that takes an integer flight_length (in minutes) and a list of integers movie_lengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether there are two numbers in movie_lengths whose sum equals flight_length.

When building your function:

* Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
* Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
* Optimize for runtime over memory



:one: [String Palindrome Permutation]()

Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome. 

Examples:

    "civic" should return True
    "ivicc" should return True
    "civil" should return False
    "livci" should return False


:two: [Word Cloud]()

Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a dictionary, where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred. 


:three: [Merge two sorted arrays]()
